    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to Wawa! A charming little town located on Wawa Lake, just off the
      coast of Lake Superior. You may know us from our magnificant Wawa Goose
      that has overlooked Highway 17 since 1963. First established as a fur
      trade fort in the 17th century, the town is now known for it's picturesque
      scenic surroundings and is, for many, a favourite Canadian road side stop
      in the summer months. Whether you're looking for trails to hike, beaches
      to relax on, or waterfalls to chase, Wawa has something for everyone!
      <br />
      If you're thinking the town quiets down in the winter, you'd be half
      right. For sure, the tourist industry dies down in the winter, with the
      freezing temperatures, icy roads and Lake Superior's firdged winds.
      However, the locals have no problem embracing the cold. You'll find many
      of the towns residents snowshoeing on snow packed trails, riding
      snowmobiles, ice fishing on the frozen Wawa Like, or even dog sledding
      around town. <br />
      The bottomline? Hot or cold, rain or shine, Wawa is the perfect get-away
      for anyone looking to escape the hustle and bustle of cities and enjoy the
      peace and serenidty of Northern Ontario.
    </p>
    <h3>Our History</h3>
    <h4>Michipicoten First Nation History</h4>
    <p>
      Wawa and it's surrounding area is rich in indigenous history. It has been
      proven that the Anishinaabeg and Ojibway people have occupied the region
      for over 7,000 years. Ancient canoe routes show that the mouth of the
      Micipicoten and Magpie Rivers were a hub of transporation with access to
      what is today northern ontario. These routes connected to other Great
      Lakes and the inland sea of Hudson's Bay. The michipicoten tribe was made
      up of several different family groups who lived the traditional way of
      life. They were dispersed over a large area of several hundred square
      miles, gathering in the summer months to make alliances of trade,
      amrriages and other shared ceremonies. Read more about Michipicoten First
      Nation and the Anishinaabeg tribe

    </p>
    <span>Fun Fact! `Wawa` in Ojibway actually means `Wild Goose`</span>
    <h4>Township History</h4>
    <p>
      With the first explorers also came economic opportunities in the fur
      trade. The Michipicoten First Nation's introduced the early explorers to
      the nearby forests in the early 1600's. Not only were our forests
      fur-rich, but Michipicoten was the ideal location for a post trade with
      the Ojibway as a rest and re-supply stop for travelers. In 1827,
      Michipicoten was name headquarters for the Lake Superior Distract of
      Hudson's Bay Company. The post was closed after 179 operative years in
      1904. <br />
      Forestry came in 1900 when pulpwood and logs for railways ties were cut
      right along the Algoma Central Railway. Many people from Eastern Canada
      found winter work in the nearby logging camps. Tree's were fell by hand
      and hauled by horses on icy winter roads and harvested wood was piles onto
      frozen lakes. Forestry continues to play a role in Wawa's economy to this
      very day.
      <br />
      When Ojibway couple Louise Towab and William Teddy uncovered a rich vein
      of gold along Wawa Lake in 1897, Wawa boomed. The next hundred years, Wawa
      was the centre of mining activity in Northern Ontario. The gold discovery
      lead to the discovery of Iron ore in 1898. During the World War Two, a
      singer plant was built in Wawa to treat to iron from Helene Mine. During
      this time, wages were high and job were in demand and Wawa became home for
      many European immigrants after the end of the war. While Iron mining is no
      longer the main source of Wawa's survival, gold and diamonds continue to
      drive Wawa's economy forward.
